                <h4 align="justify">A seed is a tiny living package that carries the power of life. Inside every seed is
                    a plant waiting to grow. When a seed is placed in the right soil, given water, air, and sunlight,
                    it starts to germinate – a small root comes out to fix itself in the soil and a tiny shoot rises
                    upward to become a plant.
                    As the plant grows, it develops leaves to make food through sunlight, stems to support itself, and
                    flowers that later turn into fruits.
                    These fruits carry new seeds, continuing the cycle of life.Seeds are nature’s way of ensuring
                    continuity, survival, and diversity. From the rice we eat, the cotton in our clothes, the fruits we
                    enjoy,
                    to the medicines we use – everything begins with a seed.</h4>

        <p align ="justify"><mark>A strawberry plant grows from a tiny seed through several stages. First, the seed germinates and develops roots and small leaves. Over the next weeks,
           the plant grows stronger, producing more leaves and stems. Around 160 days after planting, the plant matures and starts flowering. 
           These flowers then turn into juicy red strawberries, showing how a tiny seed can transform into a fruit-bearing plant with care, time, and proper conditions.A strawberry seed is tiny and may stay dormant until the conditions are right. 
           Many seeds need a cold period to break dormancy before they can grow. When the seed absorbs water, it swells and the stored food inside is activated.The seeds first germinate in 1–3 weeks, then grow into seedlings with 
           tiny leaves and roots. Over the next two months, the plant becomes stronger and produces many leaves and stems. Around three months later, 
           it starts flowering, and those flowers slowly turn into strawberries. In about 5–6 months, the fruits ripen and are ready for harvest.</mark>

<h2>India's Importance</h2>
<p align="justify">India is known for its <b>huge seed diversity</b>, as it grows <b>rice, wheat, pulses, millets, cotton, and oilseeds</b>, while also preserving many local varieties. In contrast, other countries often focus on <b>fewer major crops</b>; for example, the US mainly produces <b>maize and soybean</b>, while Brazil specializes in <b>soybean and sugarcane</b>.

When it comes to <b>hybrid seed adoption</b>, India has widely used hybrids in <b>cotton, maize, and vegetables</b>, but <b>hybrid rice and wheat adoption is still slower</b>. On the other hand, countries like the US and China grow <b>hybrid corn and hybrid rice</b> on a massive scale, which gives them <b>much higher yields</b>.

In terms of <b>seed production</b>, India has both <b>public sector players</b> like <b>NSC and State Seed Corporations</b> and <b>private companies</b> like <b>Nuziveedu, Kaveri, and Rasi</b>, creating a mix of traditional and hybrid seed supply. Meanwhile, other countries are dominated by <b>private multinational companies</b> such as <b>Monsanto, Bayer, and Syngenta</b>, which produce <b>advanced biotech seeds</b>.

For <b>quality certification</b>, India follows a <b>structured process</b> of <b>breeder, foundation, and certified seeds</b>, but many farmers still rely on <b>farm-saved seeds</b>. In developed countries, <b>quality control is much stricter</b>, and most farmers buy <b>certified or GM/hybrid seeds</b> directly.

Finally, in terms of <b>technology</b>, India only permits <b>Bt Cotton</b> as a GM crop, while <b>food GM crops are restricted</b> due to safety and policy concerns. By comparison, the USA, Brazil, and Argentina widely use <b>genetically modified maize, soybean, and canola</b>, which boosts their <b>productivity</b>.</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p align="justify">Seeds are the foundation of life and the backbone of agriculture. From a tiny seed grows a plant that provides food, clothing, and other essential resources for humans. Understanding seeds—their structure, germination, quality, 
and life cycle—helps farmers produce healthy and high-yielding crops. Hybrid seeds and advanced seed technologies have significantly improved productivity, ensuring better food security for India. With strong seed diversity, certified quality, 
and support from leading seed companies, India continues to maintain its agricultural strength while providing sustainable solutions for farmers. Ultimately, the care, knowledge, and innovation invested in seeds today shape the growth and survival of our future generations.</p>
